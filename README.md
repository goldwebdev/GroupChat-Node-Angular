## Group-Chat-Private-Chat-Application-using-MEAN-And-Socket.io
I have implemented GroupChat Application using MEAN Stack and for real time communication like sending messages ,joining and leaving rooms ,I have used Socket.IO which is a library for Real Time Web Applications.The purpose of the project is to become capable of using socket.io for RTC(Real Time Communication).

## Technologoies Used:
- Node.js(server side)
- Express.js(server side)
- Angular(client side)
- MongoDB(for storing of data)
- Angular Material Design (Front end)
- Socket.IO ( for RTC)

## Socket.IO
- Socket.IO is a powerful library for real time web  applications.It enables real time,bidirectional and event based communication between the browser and the server
- It is built on top of Websockets API and Node.js.
- It is mostly dependent on NPM.
- It is fast and reliable.Whenever any event occurs the server will get that event  and emit the event to particular connected client.

### Login and Signup  
- There is Login and Signup options for the user.I have used JWT Authentication for the user authentication.If you are not familiar with JWT then please check out this first [https://github.com/mohitsood5934/Implementing-JWT-using-Node.js]

###  GroupChat(Fully Implemented)
- From here onwards most of the things will be done by the use of sockets.
- We can see total users online displayed is null because ,user did not join any room till now.It will be shown once the user joined  room.
## Joining of the Room and sending messages to each other
- Users can join the room by pressing Join Room button
# First User
